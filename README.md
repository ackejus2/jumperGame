Title: jumperGame

Description: 

We essentially created a hangman game but instead of gallows it is a parachute.  A five letter word is to be guessed, with every wrong guess the user gets a piece of their parachute cut.  Only five tries are allowed before the user reaches the ground.  Will you make it safely down to the ground?

Project Structure:

We have a main program that facilitates the program.  We created four classes to help with the software design. Two were created for the different animations that the game has.  There is also a class that creates a word list and also contains a method to pull a random said from said list.  The last class creates a guess class that contains and displays the user's current status on guessing by displaying the words length and letters guessed correctly.  It is compartmentalized very well and runs smoothly with different integrated classes.

Require Software:
